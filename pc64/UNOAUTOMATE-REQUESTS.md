## 2026-07-22 — wall-clock guard on live network conformance checks (WiFi/net agent)

**What:** a per-check wall-clock budget in the TEST runner
(`unoauto_test_run` / the SPECTEST network suite) so a registered test that
exceeds its budget is force-recorded FAIL (or SKIP) and the run CONTINUES to
completion + power-off, instead of the guest blocking inside the test forever.

**Why:** the live network checks `S-AI-01` / `S-AI-02` (real DNS + TLS +
HTTPS to api.anthropic.com) and `S-NET-30` depend on the build host's
connectivity to the *real* endpoint at that instant. When that connectivity
hiccups, the guest stalls inside the live check and never powers off, so
`tools/spectest_qemu.py` reports **"FAIL: guest did not power off (hang?)"** for
the WHOLE batch — a false hang that looks like a code regression (it cost a full
diagnosis cycle this session: 3/3 harness "hangs" while the identical build
powered off cleanly by hand once connectivity returned, SPECTEST.TXT 62/0/4).
A blip in one live check should fail THAT check, not hang the gate.

**Where the stall lives:** the network op has no hard deadline — most likely
`tls_connect`/`tls_read` (tls.c) or `net_dns_query` (net.c), both in the
driver/WiFi-agent territory. A runner-level wall-clock guard is the general fix
(covers any future live test); a driver-level deadline in tls.c is the
complementary local fix and is on our side to add.

**Stopgap in use:** re-run the gate a few times / confirm host connectivity to
api.anthropic.com before trusting a "did not power off" result; a clean manual
boot (guest exits, complete SPECTEST.TXT) distinguishes an S-AI blip from a real
hang. No code change requested in frozen-core from our side.
